## Robot Gladiators Game!

An excellent initial approch to JavaScript, Robot Gladiators is a super sleek computer game that runs in the browser. The game is coded using only JavaScript. It consists on a series of multiple prompts to which the user has to select how they want to face battle against other robots.
