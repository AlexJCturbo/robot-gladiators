## Robot Gladiators Game!

An excellent initial approch to JavaScript. Robot Gladiators is a super sleek computer game coded using only JavaScript that runs in the browser. It consists of a series of prompts that will define the course of the battle. Players will decide if they want to attack or wait to fight later, they can select if they want to visit the shop to increase their health or attack power. The game is never the same as the power and life all robots have is random and it changes every time the user plays. Finally, you can see your final score and select if you want to fight again.
